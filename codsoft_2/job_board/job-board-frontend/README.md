## EmployerDashboard and CandidateDashboard Components:

These components will involve user authentication and will depend on how you structure your user management. They may include profile details, job posting forms, application history, etc.


## Integrate with Backend API:
Update the components where API calls are made to use the appropriate backend URL. For example, in the JobListings.js and JobDetail.js components:

Make sure to replace http://localhost:5000 with the actual URL where your backend API is hosted.
